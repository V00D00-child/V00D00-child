## Building what comes next

**TL;DR**
- 🌱 Elevating smart accounts to first-class citizens on Ethereum
- 🛡️ Experimenting with zero-knowledge primitives & privacy-first UX
- 🦀 Lets get Rusty; I trust **safe code**
- ⚡ Building an open-source ERC-4337 [Bundler](https://github.com/transeptorlabs/transeptor-bundler)
- 🔐 Engineering the safest way to interact with Ethereum
   - [Delegation framework](https://github.com/MetaMask/delegation-framework)
   - [ERC-7715 Permissions](https://github.com/MetaMask/snap-7715-permissions)

### Why it matter

Privacy, user safety, and granular consent are at the core of everything I build. To reach true mass adoption, Ethereum needs a UX **built for humans**, not just developers.
Real-world use cases demand systems that enable coordination without compromising privacy; that’s the line I refuse to cross.

## Philosophy

- **Least privilege** by design
- **User agency** over blind trust
- **Transparency** over hype
- **Privacy** as a human right
- **Open source** over closed systems; *if I can't see it I don't trust it*
- **Decentralization** over single points of failure
- **Individual sovereignty**; *freedom is the right to choose*

### One last thing

I build in public. Expect messy experiments, hard engineering, and ideas that might rewrite how payments and UX work on Ethereum.

If you value open-source innovation, star, follow, or collaborate. I’m always open to align with fellow builders.
