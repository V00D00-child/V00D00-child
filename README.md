## Building what comes next

I am working on a few projects at the moment. Here are a few that get the most of my attention:
- Experimenting with zero-knowledge primitives & privacy-first UX
- Experimenting building systems that utilize *Reciprocal capitalism* instead of *Traditional capitalism*
-  Building infrastructure that powers Account Abstraction on Ethereum:
   - ERC-4337 [Bundler](https://github.com/transeptorlabs/transeptor-bundler)
- Bringing Readable permissions to Ethereum:
   - [Delegation framework](https://github.com/MetaMask/delegation-framework)
   - [ERC-7715 Permissions](https://github.com/MetaMask/snap-7715-permissions)

## Philosophy

I build in public, so expect messy experiments, breaking things, and moving fast. My ideas are far out there, but they have the potential to redefine how payments and UX operate on Ethereum.
